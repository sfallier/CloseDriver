### 2.1.3 Phase Shift

`PhaseOffset` in the app.

The angular position of the motor is a key characteristic, which is usually indicated by the motor manufacturer. Most of the hub motors on the market are 30°, 210° and 90°, but there are some special motors. Note that the motor factory labeling method is different from the far drive logo, if you are not sure about the angle, you can find this value through self-learning methods.

Generally, the error of phase shift between two operations is not more than 2°, which proves that there is no problem in the operation method and the phase shift is not a problem.

#### 2.1.3.1 Start Self-learning With a Host

Click the self-learning button on the host (computer, phone), and you will hear 2 short and 1 long sounds inside the controller, prompting that self-learning has been started.

In addition, click the cancel self-learning button on the host, and the prompt sound disappears, indicating that self-learning has been canceled.

#### 2.1.3.2 Start Self-learning Without a Host

This method is applicable to all controllers with brake line function installed, ND series, CN series, BN series controllers with software version 783 or above. Version A01 and above requires that you hold the handlebars before turning on the machine, and do not let go, following these operations:

1. Keep the brake connected, the controller is off and the motor is stationary.
2. Turn the throttle wide open and turn on the machine. At this time, the controller alarms and the motor does not rotate.
3. Enter self-learning sequence, Morse code 8 bits: `11000000`:
    * 1: Long squeeze brake 0.5 sec-2 sec
    * 0: Short squeeze brake less than 0.5 sec

When you hear 2 short and 1 long, you are in self-learning mode. If you don't hear it, consider that you have made a mistake and try to re-enter the Morse code.

#### 2.1.3.3 Self-learning Process

After entering the self-learning state, suspend the wheel off the ground and hold the throttle wide open. At this time, the motor should start to rotate. If it does not rotate, it may be that the Hall line has been swapped or the motor line has been swapped. At this time, you only need to swap the blue and green large lines to make it rotate.

After it rotates, the speed will be close to the motor fixed speed, and then the phase shift will be automatically adjusted to adapt to the motor. Then the motor will reverse and adapt to the motor. After the automatic completion, the motor stops. You can release the throttle. The self-learning is completed.

A well-trained motor will remain quiet.

#### 2.1.3.4 Changing the direction of the motor via Morse code

After the self-learning is completed, if you find that the normal startup motor is reversed, then you can modify the motor direction through a host, you can also change the motor direction through the Morse code sequence `11110000`. If you find that the motor is reversed after the motor self-learning, you can correct the direction of the motor through this instruction.

#### 2.1.3.5 Limit the speed via Morse code:

`MorseCode` in the app.

The Morse code can be changed through a host to set 6 digits to release the speed limit. There is no restriction when the value is `000000` (default). When enabled, you must enter the Morse code every time the unit is powered on in order to release the speed limit.

Setting the 7-digit Morse code is the speed limit, which is also the 6-digit number after the operation. The speed limit will be converted once after each operation: if it is originally a speed-limited state, it will become a non-speed-limited state, and vice versa. This conversion is saved inside the controller, and it will switch to this state every time it is turned on.

### 2.1.4 Pole Pairs

Hall motors default to 4 and does not need to change. The pole pair setting for encoder motors must be accurate otherwise it can not rotate. Selectable values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16-30, Encoder: 3-8 Pole Pairs display the actual rotation speed, above 10 pole pairs display the rotation speed according to 4 poles pairs. To modify the number of pole pairs, you have to click save to make it effective.

### 2.1.5 Motor Direction

Specifies the motor direction when moving forward.

* 0: Sprocket is on the right
* 1: Sprocket is on the left

Only effective after reset and save.

### 2.1.6 Rated Speed

The speed of the motor at the rated voltage, referred to as the rated speed, is often referred to as the fixed speed in the electric motorcycle industry. This fixed speed determines the highest motor speed. Generally speaking, a common controller can drive the motor to the maximum speed near the fixed speed under the rated voltage. The controller will recognize the rated speed at the current voltage during self-learning.

### 2.1.7 Rated Voltage

The maximum number of strings of batteries for the NJ Far Drive Controller for different voltages is as follows:

| Voltage | Lead-acid | Lithium Ion | Lithium Iron Phosphate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 48V | 4 | 13-14 | 16 |
| 60V | 5 | 17 | 20 |
| 72V | 6 | 21 | 24 |
| 75V | 6 | 22 | 25 |
| 84V | 7 | 24 | 28  |
| 96V | 8 | 28 | 32 |
| 108V | 9 | 32 | 35-36 |

🎧 Factory Settings 72 Series=72V,75 Series=75V,84 Series=84V,96 Series=96V, Series=108V

Note that the rated voltage affects the power display, the setting can not be higher than 🎧factory voltage, after setting the parameters, you have to tap save again, valid after reset.

### 2.1.8 Rated Power

The rated power of the motor, please set it according to the actual condition of the motor.

### 2.1.9 Maximum Speed

Limits the maximum motor speed. In the EV market, the maximum speed is usually not limited, but the maximum speed is limited by the current limiting parameter at the back. After the speed exceeds the fixed speed, it automatically enters the weak magnetization state. The more the speed exceeds the fixed speed, the greater the depth of weak magnetization.

Depth of weak magnetization: `(Maximum speed - Fixed speed) / Fixed speed * 100%`. Generally, hub motors can be weakly magnetized up to 50%.

Some hub motors can have a weak magnetic depth of more than 100%. Therefore, we stipulate that the weak magnetic depth of surface-mounted motors should not exceed 50%, while the weak magnetic depth of embedded motors should not exceed 150%.

### 2.1.10 Maximum Phase Current

Maximum value of phase line current of the operating motor. Determines the motor output 🎧 maximum torque at standstill to rated speed.

The maximum phase current has a maximum limit on the controller hardware, and the set value is not allowed to exceed 🎧🎧 factory setting. Failure to do so will result in a much higher probability of the controller burning out.

Different types of motors will exhibit different output 🎧 torque for the same maximum phase current setting. The torque version of the motor has a high output 🎧 torque, the balanced version has a slightly lower output 🎧 torque, and the speed version of the motor has the smallest output 🎧 torque. The motor with low fixed speed has a high loss 🎧 torque and the motor with high fixed speed has a low loss 🎧 torque.

### 2.1.11 Maximum Line Current

The maximum value of the controller's working battery bus current. Determines the maximum power output of the motor. Controller maximum input power = battery voltage * maximum line current. This current is limited to the customer's maximum line current. This value determines the maximum output power, and thus the maximum speed.

### 2.1.12 Reverse Speed

Maximum RPM for reverse.

### 2.1.13 Swap Phase Wires

`PhaseExchange` in the app.

Default is 0, if the blue and green lines are swapped, it is 1. Note that if this parameter is incorrect, the motor will not rotate.

This parameter is valid after reset and is automatically modified by the Hxx version self-learning.

### 2.1.14 Weak magnetic properties

General fast, high speed jitter big change to medium, generally do not use slow, easy to overcurrent

### 2.1.15 Weak magnetic response

0-6, none means no weak magnetization. Default weak magnetic response 0 Speed Expansion: Pushing the motor speed to a higher speed than the fixed speed is called speed expansion.

1. Increase the working voltage, the higher the voltage, the higher the motor speed.
2. Do not increase the working voltage, through the weak magnetization, increase the speed of the motor.

Without changing the battery voltage, the motor speed is increased directly by controlling the current limiting parameter.

## 2.2 Acceleration and deceleration characteristics

### 2.2.1 Acceleration sensitivity

Acceleration speed, 8-224, the higher the number, the faster the throttle response.

An electric car is usually a gas pedal, while an electric motorcycle is a gas turn knob or center control.

While an electric car should have a moderate response to the gas pedal, the requirements of an electric motorcycle are different; some customers require it to be light, slow, and steady, while others require it to be responsive and ready at the touch of a button.

Acceleration sensitivity refers to how fast or slow the throttle response is. This parameter ranges from 16 to 224. The larger the number, the more sensitive the throttle acceleration. 16 is already slow, and a setting of 32 is generally appropriate for electric vehicles, rarely exceeding 64.

For electric motorcycle, besides setting at 32, many users prefer fast response, so setting at 64, 128. track race even set at 224.

### 2.2.2 Deceleration sensitivity

Deceleration speed: 16-224, the higher the number the shorter the return throttle lag.

### 2.2.3 Motor position

Non-set value, display of motor angle

### 2.2.4 Throttle Return

Default 0

### 2.2.5 Throttle Response

According to different user preferences, the throttle characteristics have three configurations: linear, sporty, and economical.

### 2.2.6 Economic acceleration parameters

Default 8

### 2.3 Throttle Threshold

Throttles on the market are uneven, and the voltage value will vary from throttle to throttle or gas pedal to gas pedal.

| | Idle voltage | High voltage |
|---|---|---|
| Electric Motorcycle | 0.8V-0.9V | 4.1-4.3V |
| Central control handle | 0.8V-0.9V | 4.5-4.95V |
| 12V Accelerator pedal | 0.0V-0.2V | 4.6-4.8V |

### 2.3.1 Low Threshold

We set the low throttle threshold based on the idle voltage. Considering the fluctuation of the throttle voltage, setting the low throttle threshold should generally be 0.2-0.3V higher than the idle voltage, in order to ensure that the motor is working in the idle state when stopping. For example, the low throttle threshold for an electric motorcycle throttle would be set to 1.1V, while the low throttle threshold for a 12V gas pedal would be set to 0.5V.

### 2.3.2 High Threshold

We set the high throttle threshold based on the full bar voltage. In order to make the controller capable of delivering 🎧full power in the full bar state rate, we need to get the setting below the full handle voltage. But here we have to be careful not to set it too low. In order to automatically detect whether there is any damage to the electronic throttle, we set a value 0.6V higher than the high throttle threshold as the alarm limit, once exceeded, it is considered that the throttle is damaged, and the controller immediately stops the power loss 🎧 to avoid the vehicle from flying, to avoid causing a flying safety accident.

So when we set a high throttle threshold, for example, 4 .1-4.3V for an electric motorcycle throttle full handle, we would set the 3.9V as the high throttle threshold. For a 12V gas pedal we would set the high throttle threshold at 4.3V.

The 742 and above versions add a throttle self-learning function. When turning to the bottom during self-learning, the controller automatically recognizes the maximum voltage of the throttle signal from the throttle/pedal and generates a throttle high threshold based on this voltage.

# 3 Current Limit

![image](/images/8.jpg)

## 3.1 Motor current limiting protection factor

Conversion of 500RPM, 1000RPM,...8500RPM, and 9000RPM in current limit.

These speeds are based on the number of poles calibrated in the parameters. For motors with an actual pole pair number greater than or equal to 16, a conversion is required. 

Usually the pole pair number of the hub motor is 16, 20, 24, 28, 30 pole pairs.

And usually the mid-mounted motor is 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 14 pole pairs.

If the number of pole pairs = 4 in the parameter, the motor speed = the speed on the host computer * 4 / the actual number of pole pairs of the motor. For example, if the pole pair number of the hub motor is 16:

|Listed RPM|Actual RPM|
|---|---|
| 500RPM | 125RPM |
| 1000RPM | 250RPM |
| 4000RPM | 1000RPM |
| 5000RPM | 1250RPM |
| 5500RPM | 1375RPM |
| 6000RPM | 1500RPM |
| 6500RPM | 1625RPM |
| 8000RPM | 2000RPM |

Weak magnetism limitation: gradual increase of current limiting parameters. 

The setting of the current limit value starts from the safe value and gradually increases the speed. It is necessary to ensure that the weak magnetic field is not excessive. Once the idling speed is found to be unstable or even MOE or OVER protection is triggered, it means that the speed is too high and the weak magnetic field is excessive. The parameters should be changed back.

The current limit value we set should be considered according to the actual demand. For a motor with a fixed speed of 1000RPM, the depth of weak magnetization is considered to be 50%. The maximum speed is also considered to be 1500RPM, and it is hoped that the motor will not operate above 1625RPM. Therefore, the current limit value is set at 30% for 6000RPM and less than 5% for 6500RPM and above.

This ensures that the motor is only 50% weakly magnetized when idling. This ensures that the motor is only 50% weak when idling, and that it will not be too weakly magnetized, causing the motor to jitter or even burn out.

In many motors, the depth of weak magnetization can reach 100%, and 1000RPM motors can operate at high speeds of 2000RPM. For this type of motor, the current limiting factor can be expanded in order to maximize performance. The current limiting parameter can be set above the normal value of 70 for 8000RPM, 30 for 8500, and below 5 for 9000RPM.

## 3.2 Speed Control Rating

# 4 Energy Regeneration

![image](/images/9.jpg)

For the throttle return brake function, during riding, the electronic brake state will be entered after the throttle is returned.

For the electronic brake function, when braking, the whole vehicle sends a brake signal to the controller, and the controller enters the electronic brake state after detecting the brake signal.

Note that when using the electronic brake function, you must select electronic brake or throttle return brake in the follow item to enable this function. And set the return current. Note that when setting parameters, the maximum return current is generally 25%~50% larger than the stop return current.

## 4.1 Brake current limitation

### 4.1.1 Brake current

Brake current for e-brake. Default 2A, change to 5A-20A as needed when you need e-brake strength, for the large capacity battery of 4-wheeler, its back-charging current is allowed to be bigger, it can be set to 20A-60A.

### 4.1.2 Maximum brake current:

Peak braking current of electronic brake: 4A by default, can be set to 10A-40A when strong braking is required, and 40A-80A can be considered for four-wheel vehicles.

### 4.1.3 Throttle return brake point

Default is 0, the faster the throttle return speed, the smaller the braking force. Slow speed, light braking force. 

1: The braking force is the greatest when the throttle is returned. Above this speed, turning the handlebar back halfway is a constant speed without acceleration or deceleration. For example, 4000 means that the higher the speed from 0 to 4000, the closer it is to half the throttle value. The middle throttle value above 4000 is a constant speed without acceleration or deceleration. When the handlebar is higher than the middle value, it accelerates, and when it is lower than the middle value, it decelerates. The more you turn the handlebar back, the stronger the brakes.

## 4.2 Negative current coefficient

The scale factor that controls the reverse charge current is controlled at 500rpm, 1000rpm,...,9000rpm. The maximum value of the coefficient is 0 and the minimum value is -100. The closer to -100, the more negative the current.

For ordinary two-wheeled vehicles, for the controller about 400A, negative current factor -10%--30% is enough. Other controllers should be adjusted according to the situation. For the sake of driving safety, you can start from -10% to debug, if you think it is not enough, then change it to -15%, -20%, don't set it to -50%--100% all of a sudden, as this kind of operation is easy to bring the danger of braking sharply.

Older versions of the controller do not come with a negative current factor.

| 0-Default Neutral | Startup defaults to N, FW ground = forward, RE ground = reverse. |
| 1-Default forward | Startup default forward gear, RE ground = reverse, can have P gear (same as N) |
| 2-Reverse Gap | FW grounded = neutral, otherwise RE grounded = reverse, RE overhang = forward |
| 3-Default Tap Low |  Series H: FW enters burglar alarm lockout while suspended. Grounding allows traveling. Other series: default forward low speed |
| 4-Default Points in Motion | Other series: default forward medium speed, pointing |
| 5-Default point movement height | Other series: default forward high speed, pointing |

### 5.2.4 Brakes

* Brake function: you can travel when you don't squeeze the brake, and disconnect the throttle when you squeeze the brake.
* FLOATING: Pinch brake with high brake wire connected to 12V or battery voltage. Or the low brake leg is connected to battery ground. Note that the brake line signals are not isolated. When the brakes are not pinched, both wires should be floating.
* Floatation disconnection: When the brake is pinched, both high brake and low brake wires are floating. When the brake is not pinched, the high brake wire is connected to 12V or battery voltage, or the low brake foot is connected to battery ground, note that the brake wire signal is not isolated.
* P+Floating: In addition to the function of floating, release the P-gear state at the same time when squeezing the brake. P+Float
* Power-off: In addition to the float power-off function, squeeze the brake to release the P gear at the same time. Invalid: Default float traveler.

### 5.2.5 PC13

Parameters of the old controller: float travel, float disconnect, float cruise, ground cruise, invalid.

H series controller parameters: Normal response and track response.

### 5.2.6 Morse Code

1. The Morse code can be changed through the host computer to set 6 digits to release the speed, no restriction when 000000, restriction when any other code: it is necessary to operate the Morse code every time the power is turned on in order to release the speed limit.

2. Setting the 7-digit Morse code is the speed limit switch, which also operates the last 6 digits, and the speed limit will be changed once: if it was a speed limit state, it will be changed to a non-speed limit state, and vice versa. This switch is saved inside the controller, and it will be switched to this state when the controller is turned on in the future.

### 5.2.7 Incline braking

Shift into gear and hold on an incline: When moving forward or backward, releasing the accelerator will cause the car to hold on a slope. In neutral, the car will not hold, and the steep slope descent function is invalid. Hold the hill in P gear: Hold the hill in P gear. In other states, the steep slope descent function is enabled according to the steep slope descent parameter setting.

Invalid: The hold hill function and steep slope descent function are invalid.

### 5.2.8 Follow

* Follow: The motor starts at a certain idle speed
* Invalid: Block follow and electronic brake
* Electronic brake: Start the electronic brake when you squeeze the brake.
* Throttle brake: Start the electronic brake when you release the throttle

### 5.2.9 Hill Descent Control

* None: Hill Descent Control is not enabled.
* 1~7: The smaller the number, the slower the hill descent control response, and the larger the number, the faster the hill descent control response.

Parking effect: A small hill descent control number will cause more back movement but be stable, while a large number will cause less back movement but too much forward movement.

### 6.2.15 Byte Options

0, 1, 2, 3: contact Fardriver to adjust parameters

### 6.2.16 one-stop debugging

Most of the One-Wire default 21, byte option = 3 can basically show the speed, some meters can not show. You can try to use 1-Wire but do not know the protocol, the step size is recommended 0.9ms, the interval time is recommended 216ms, try 1-Wire to see if the meter has feedback:

1. Try special frame 16 first, byte option = 3.
2. Try parameter set 1 first: PUSLE=0,SQH=0,DATA0=8,DATA1=97.
3. If not, try parameter group 2: PUSLE=0,SQH=0,DATA0=89,DATA1=66.
4. If it does not pass then parameter other parameter groups. See the table that follows for details.
5. If all parameter groups are invalid, go to 3.2.
6. If special frame 16 does not respond, change to 16,32,48,64,80,96,112,128,144,160,176,192,208.
7. In general, try the above special frames to find the correct one line pass, for details of the voltage and power display is not correct, then a small range of special frame modification to meet the requirements: for example, to find 48 speed can be displayed normally, but the voltage and power or current display is not correct, then you can try to modify the special frame between 48 - 63 to correct the number. For example, if you find 160 speed can be displayed normally, but the voltage or current display is not correct, then you can try to modify the numbers between 160-175 in the special frame to correct the problem. If the display of P-position is inaccurate, you can modify the position of P-position to meet the display requirement.
8. If the above operations do not display the One-Wire communication correctly, try steps 3.1-3.3 again with a step size of 0.5ms.
9. For none of the above operations can you display a one-line pass. Consider special frames 247 or 248.
10. If none of the above works, then you need to contact the Fardriver to analyze the specific 224 or other special frames from 240-255.

## 7.1 Voltage Protection

### 7.1.1 Overvoltage protection, recovery

Internal setting based on rated voltage

### 7.1.2 Undervoltage protection, recovery

When the battery voltage approaches the undervoltage protection point, the controller reduces the power output so that the battery will not be over-discharged and damaged. The general battery undervoltage setting is as follows:

| Voltage | 48V | 60V | 72V | 84V | 96V | 108V |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Undervoltage Point | 42V | 52.5V | 63V | 73.5V | 84V | 94.5V |

### 7.1.3 Undervoltage mode

`LowVol Way` in the app.

* +2V: Power reduction starts when the voltage reaches 2V above the undervoltage point.
* +4V: Power reduction starts when the voltage reaches 4V above the undervoltage point.
* +8V: Power reduction starts when the voltage reaches 8V above the undervoltage point.
* +12V: Power reduction starts when the voltage reaches 12V above the undervoltage point.
* +16V: Power reduction starts when the voltage reaches 16V above the undervoltage point.
* SOC 5%: Power reduction when the battery capacity is less than or equal to 20%, and slow mode when less than or equal to 5%. 
* SOC 6%: Power reduction when the battery capacity is less than or equal to 30%, and slow mode when less than or equal to 6%.
* SOC 7%: Power reduction when the battery capacity is less than or equal to 40%, and slow mode when less than or equal to 7%.
* SOC 8%: Power reduction when the battery capacity is less than or equal to 50%, and slow mode when less than or equal to 8%.
* SOC 9%: Power reduction when the battery capacity is less than or equal to 60%, and slow mode when less than or equal to 9%.
* SOC 10%: Power reduction when the battery capacity is less than or equal to 70%, and slow mode when less than or equal to 10%.

## 7.4 Battery Protection

### 7.4.1 Power factor

**Calibrates the parameters displayed in the 0 capacity display.**

The controller itself can estimate the battery charge, and by adjusting the 0 charge factor and the full charge factor you can get a more accurate display of the charge. When the battery is full, adjust the full charge factor so that the displayed capacity is exactly 100%. When the battery is dead, adjust the 0 capacity factor so that the displayed capacity matches the power level. For example, when there is 10% battery power left, adjust the 0 capacity factor so that the display will be exactly 10%.

### 7.4.2 Full power factor

# 8 PID Control

![image](/images/14.jpg)

## 8.1 AN

Motor body characteristics AN value, parameter range 0-16.

Standard surface mount motor AN=0. Standard IPM motor AN=16.

This parameter setting must be consistent with the motor characteristics. The AN value of the embedded mid-mounted motor is not less than 8. Encoder mid-mounted motors matched with remote drives and automotive permanent magnet synchronous motors all adopt AN=16.

All hub motors on the market are surface mount motors, and the AN value is generally set to 0 and not exceed 4. If the AN value is set incorrectly, the starting efficiency will be low.
There is even MOE/OVER protection.

## 8.2 LM

Vehicle motor acceleration matching parameter. This value is used to adjust the smoothness of the motor running on the vehicle.

The default setting for cars is 22, and the default setting for electric motorcycles is 18. For some small-power tricycles, 10 or less is more suitable.

However, some motor types are poorly matched with the whole vehicle, and obvious resonance vibrations can be felt at the low-speed and medium-speed stages of the start. Adjusting the LM value will improve it.

Start with 22. If the acceleration vibrations occur at low speeds, reduce the LM and test the effect from 16, 14, 12, 11, 8, and 5. The numbers in the middle will also work. Generally, it is better to be larger and try not to be too small. Too small will not be able to control the current, causing MOE/OVER protection, or even burning the control. Therefore, the LM value after the vibration disappears is the best parameter, and do not adjust it down.

Some motors and vehicles are very smooth when LM=22, but will cause jitter when it is reduced. Therefore, if there is no problem when LM=22, do not adjust this parameter.

Or if jitter resonance occurs, and the LM value is reduced from 22 to 16, 14, . . . or even 5, it does not have much effect, which means it is not related to this parameter. At this time, you must change it back to the maximum value, such as 22, instead of keeping a random number in the controller.

## 8.3 PID parameters: StartKI,MidKI,MaxKI / StartKP,MidKP,MaxKP

Default parameters StartKI=4,MidKI=8,MaxKI=12 / StartKP=40,MidKP=80,MaxKP=120.

The higher the motor power, the higher the voltage, the smaller the PID, the PID parameters can not be filled in casually, otherwise it will lead to abnormal operation or even burn control. The following are the commonly used PID setting parameters. There are 9 sets of parameters in total, choose one of them to match the motor vehicle and modify it under the guidance of professionals.

| StartKI | MidKI | MaxKI | StartKP | MidKP | MaxKP | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 10 | 10 | 10 | Surfboard Default

| 10 | 15 | 22 | 100 | 150 | 220 |
| 16 | 16 | 24 | 160 | 160 | 240 | Small power motors

Note that improper PID parameter settings will cause the system to work abnormally, and even MOE/OVER/PHASE failures, etc. Too large a difference will cause burnout, so pay special attention.

Note that the PID parameters of some small-power motors exceed the controller debugging range. In this case please contact YuanDrive to solve the problem.
